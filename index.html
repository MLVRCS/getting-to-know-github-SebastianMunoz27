<h1>Why Cristano Ronalo and Mbappe beat Messi anytime of the day.</h1>
<p>Mbappe and Cr7 are both very good players in the footbal comunity. Some might debate that Ronaldo is getting old and R9 is better than him. But actually he has been doing great in Al Nassr. He is makijng his mark in the football comunity showing that he is not washed up. He is proving evreryone wrong.Mbappe on the other hand is one of the greats as well. Sure he is only 24 years old but he is an amazing player. Sure he lost the World Cup but he has been going very strong. Thier latest game on Febuary 26 PSG (the club he is in) won 3 to 0. Lionel Messi is also on PSG. Sure he won the world cup but in my opinon and many other's, Mbappe and Ronaldo could defeat Him anytime of the day. </p>
